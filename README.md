# asteroids-redux
Asteroids-Redux is a clone of Asteroids, written in C++ for Windows 10. The code was originally written 2014 using DirectX9. 

I have spent a little time in 2018 modernizing and cleaning up the code as well as porting to DirectX 11. 

## Building the code
The code requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 with the games packages to compile. It requires DirectXTK Nuget package too but VS should automatically install this.
